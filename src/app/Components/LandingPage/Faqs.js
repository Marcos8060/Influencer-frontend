Just a clear voice and a bit of sparkle."

      title: "What's a social media influencer?",

      title: "What is influencer re-targeting?",

A yoga page with 90% tractor fans might raise eyebrows."

      content: "Micro-influencers (10Kâ€“100K followers) tend to have highly engaged audiences.\nThink: a loyal crew who trust your word more than a celebrity's #spon.\nBrands love micros because of that authentic connection. So yes â€” sometimes smaller is stronger."

      content: "It's the ratio of people who interact with your content versus your total followers.\nFormula: (Likes + Comments) Ã· Followers x 100\nA high engagement rate = you've got influence, not just followers.\nAnd brands? They live for this metric."
